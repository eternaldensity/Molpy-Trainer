## Design Planning

OTTers will need to sign into an account as a Molpy Trainer.

A Trainer will start out with a small amount of currency to trade for various items.

A Trainer must catch a molpy to train. Molpies are caught by putting bait in a bag.

Trainers can have multiple molpies.

Various items and activities (to be determined) will increase or decrease various traits and abilities of molpies.

Each kind of molpy has its own basic traits and abilities which will be uniquely customised by training.

Trainers can battle their molpies for prizes and bragging rights. (Or Bagging rights)

Combat will consist of several rounds, and different molpies will be designed for short matches, some long matches, some in the middle.

Trainers will select the match type and length.

Perhaps multiplayer battles. Teams even.

Cram everything full of OTTish words of course.

Pingpong balls will be involved somehow.

And grapevines. Lots of grapevines. At a 12:2 molpy:grapevine ratio
